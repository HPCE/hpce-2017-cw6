HPCE CW6 Individual Reflection
==============================

Imperial login : xxx

CW5 group : zzzz

CW6 group : abcdefgh

_If you said "Other", then briefly, where are you from (e.g. "BioEng 4")?
Otherwise, remain a teapot._

Guidance
--------

_The goal of this component is to get people to think about what they
have learnt in an individual sense, and to try to think about how
this course has developed or changed your own skills, knowledge, and/or attitudes.
This section is individually marked, so I (m8pple) will look at
every single submitted `reflection.md` and evaluate it. There may
or may not be feedback provided on this component (and if there is,
it will come way off in Feb or something). Usually most people will say
something sensible and realistic, which is the main point, and
serves as immediate feedback in and of itself. I'm most likely
to comment if the points made are particularly good, or particularly
vague, generic, dismissive. Ideally these should be specific to an individual,
not to a group, so I suggest doing it alone._

_There is no hard marks schema (I moderate across the cohort),
no example answers, and I'm not seeking a specific answer. A response
given by one student might be excellent, but almost the same response by
another might look quite weak - it all depends on individual context.
Each of the 50 word responses is weighted equally._

_A possible response to some questions could be: "I haven't learnt
anything, I already knew how to do it." That's awesome, presumably
made this course very easy, and should be reflected in the
performance-oriented marks for CW5+CW6. Not everyone gets something from the
course: some people just need to get marks or pick something they already
know how to do. Those who already knew the content or have covered it in
other courses should (theoretically) cruise through. An entirely intentional
aspect of this component is that those who already have the most experience
will need to work that bit harder to justify why and where they have learnt
something._

_The load of this component is expected to be at most an hour per
person, and up to 500 words. *You do not need to write 500 words to
get good marks.* The 50 word limit per answer [is mainly to encourage
specific-ness and reduce work-load](https://github.com/HPCE/hpce-2017-cw6/issues/42)._

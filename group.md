When asked for who is responsible for things, these are
to gently steer marks where appropriate, e.g. for a
particularly good idea. The change in marks is not
great (at most 10% of this component), but is to at
least try to assign some kind of individual weighting.
Most ideas can genuinely be attributed to someone (even
if they are then developed as a grop), and even if
you are pair programming, there is someone who takes
more of a lead.
